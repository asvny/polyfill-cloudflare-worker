/*
 * The detect and tests for the focusin/focusout polyfill have been shown to not work reliably. 
 * See https://github.com/Financial-Times/polyfill-service/issues/213 for details.
 * The polyfill itself appears to work fine, but events programmatically fired during page load 
 * while dev tools is open appear not to be observable by the polyfill, which makes the test and 
 * detect unreliable.  We're continuing to serve the polyfill as it's pretty simple but would 
 * love to get some better insight into this problem.
